# ME597-Spring2025

This repository contains my personal work and solutions for **ME597: Autonomous Systems** (Spring 2025), based on the official course materials provided in the [Purdue-ME597/ME597-Spring2025](https://github.com/Purdue-ME597) GitHub repository.

All code, notes, and exercises here follow the weekly modules from the course, covering topics in robot setup, ROS 2 basics, kinematics, control, navigation, and perception.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `0-Setup`: Installation and environment setup for ROS 2 and related tools.
- `1-ROS_2_Basics`: Intro to ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and launch files.
- `2-Kinematics_&_Control`: Robot kinematics, PID control, and velocity commands.
- `3-Navigation`: ath planning, SLAM, and autonomous navigation tested in both simulation and real-life robot platforms.
- `4-Perception`: Camera and LiDAR-based perception, object detection, and tracking.

Each folder contains exercises, scripts, and notes corresponding to that week's topic.

## üì¶ Dependencies

- ROS 2 Humble
- Python3
- Jupyter Notebook
- `colcon` build system
- `rviz`, `gazebo`, and other ROS packages as listed in the setup

See `0-Setup` for the complete dependency list and installation steps.

## ‚úÖ Notes

- All work here is done independently as a learning exercise.
- If you're taking ME597AS, **do not copy code directly**.
